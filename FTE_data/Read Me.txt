The two sectors, "Social services" and "Membership organizations" under category "Social services and membership organizations" miss data during 1948-1974,
after analysing the data trends, I interpolate the missing data such that "Social services" equals floor(1/3*"Social services and membership organizations") and "Membership organizations" equals ceiling(2/3*"organizations Social services and membership organizations").
